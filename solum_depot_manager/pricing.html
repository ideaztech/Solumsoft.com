          <h4>Remote Service</h4>
          <p>The Remote Service plan includes prompt remote support when required. It also includes both downtime support and regular preventative maintenance that can be done remotely. In most cases we can fix the problem remotely. Therefore, we recommend this support plan to all our customers since it is most cost effective.</p>
          <h6>Downtime support</h6>
          <ul>
            <li>Response times: Your telephone or email support request will be responded to remotely and every effort will be made to repair the problem remotely.
              <ul>
                <li>Remote support response within 3 working hours. (8AM – 6PM Weekdays)</li>
                <li>Weekend support is also included but the response time may be longer in some cases.</li>
              </ul>
            </li>
            <li>Hardware failures: In cases where there is a hardware failure, we will recommend if the hardware can be repaired promptly or if it will need to be sent for repairs or replaced with new.
              <ul>
                <li>If the hardware device needs to be shipped away for repairs, we will handle the warranty paperwork but the depot will be responsible for the shipping and any related charges.</li>
                <li>If the hardware must be replaced with new, we will provide some purchase options but the final decision of the purchase will be up to the depot owner. This agreement does not cover the replacement costs.</li>
                <li>If a computer is replaced or repaired, we will setup and configure the Solum software again.</li>
              </ul>
            </li>
          </ul>
          <h6>Preventative Maintenance</h6>
          <ul>
            <li>Every 3 months the following maintenance jobs will be done remotely
              <ul>
                <li>Check the database backup. Is the backup being done on a daily schedule? Does the backup copy work? We will take the previous day’s backup and confirm that it can be opened and is complete.</li>
                <li>Optimize computer stations. We find that some settings get changed so that the customer screen doesn’t work or looks funny, or the computers slow down. We will check that all the settings on each station are optimized for the best performance.</li>
                <li>Install updates. There may be Solum updates, Windows updates, or Anti-virus updates that need to be installed. These will be completed during our maintenance.</li>
              </ul>
            </li>

          <p>The Full Service plan includes prompt remote support and onsite support within one business day when required. It also includes both downtime support and regular preventative maintenance that helps to prevent downtime.</p>
          <h6>Downtime support</h6>
          <ul>
            <li>Your telephone or email support request will be responded to remotely if possible. If a site visit is required, we will visit your location to fix the problem on site.
              <ul>
                <li>Remote support response within 3 working hours. (8AM – 6PM Weekdays)</li>

              <ul>
                <li>Replace one server hard drive with new. Each of our servers has two hard drives that mirror each other. If one drive crashes the other will keep running. We will replace one of those drives each year, alternating which drive is replaced each year. Thus the server hard drives will never be more than 2 years old.</li>
                <li>Replace UPS Battery on server. The UPS battery backup is to save the server when there is a power failure. However, we find that sometimes the batteries in the UPS shorts out or fail after a couple years. When this happens, the server shuts down and will not turn on until the UPS is replaced. Therefore we find it is best just to replace the battery or complete UPS before it fails. If the server does not have a UPS battery backup, a new one will be provided after the first year of support.</li>

        <h6>Availability</h6>
